 *A simple Discord Bot made with flexability in mind.*

For most people (including myself), the scope of Discord bots are simple, focusing just on simple responce commands. **PersonBot** serves as a base for making those bots, leaving less coding and hair pulling and more laughing at injokes with your friends. 

## Usage
**PersonBot** is setup to be run with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), so you don't have to waste system resources on the bot. You can still run it on your computer normally, just by executing the `bot.pi` file.
